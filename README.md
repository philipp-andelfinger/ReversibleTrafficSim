# Reversible Simulation and Reverse Exploration of Microscopic Traffic Models

## Dependencies:
* libfixmath: https://code.google.com/archive/p/libfixmath/
* pygame (visualization only): https://www.pygame.org/

## Instructions

Run 'make' to build the project.

* './run_exploration.sh' runs an example reverse exploration, printing debug output to 'exploration.txt' and mobility traces in the folder 'traces'.
* './rev_vis.py traces' visualizes a random sample of the generated mobility traces.
* './run_reverse_sim.sh' runs an example forward and reverse simulation, printing debug output to 'reverse_sim.txt'.
